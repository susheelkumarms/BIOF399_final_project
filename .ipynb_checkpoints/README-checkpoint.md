# This repo is for the final project for BIOF399 course 

# Aim of project

To make a model to predict the stage of Alzheimers using CNNs

## Data
Data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images

About the data directory.
The MRI Images have already been converted to .jpg in the dataset
Dataset consists of two files - Training and Testing both containing a total of around ~5000 images each segregated into the severity of Alzheimer's

Classes:

1. MildDemented
2. VeryMildDemented
3. NonDemented 
4. ModerateDemeneted

## This repository contains 

### The data set is also present in this repository "Alzheimer_s Dataset"

### The final file with all the code is final_project_SK.ipynb in this repository

### The pretrained model is alzheimer_model.h5

### You can look at the "final_project_SK.pdf" file for the results and the way the code runs

### The model summary is present "modelsummary.txt" and "model.png"

### The results from fitting the test dataset to the model are present in "modelscores_on_test_dataset.txt"
